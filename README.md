# agon-notes-and-examples

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to write in public a set of notes and examples that can be compiled into a standalone document that can be viewed offline and optionally printed and ringbound for that ultimate retro computing experience.

The official support channel for the Agon lightâ„¢ [1] - and effectively for the AgonLight2 [2] as well - is a Facebook group. This project will hopefully provide an alternative for those who either refuse to use Facebook or refuse to use Facebook with their real identity (ahem!) and thus fall foul of the Community Guidelines for that platform, as well as being of use to those who are willing social media participants but want to have a reference to refer to offline.

## Very High-level Roadmap

- Compile notes and BASIC code examples in plain text (markdown?)
- Set up a means of converting markdown documents into PDFs, epub and HTML (ASCIIdoctor? Pandoc?)
- Release compiled output 
- Revise based on feedback
